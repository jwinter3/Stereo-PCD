# Examples

The `.py` files in this directory show examples of how to use the library. Before running them, you must complete the paths to the datasets found in these scripts (replace "..." with the path of the main dataset directory). Where to download these datasets from is described in section [Datasets](../README.md#datasets).

The `.txt` files containing the pointclouds generated by these scripts can be loaded into the visualization tool MeshLab (https://www.meshlab.net/).
